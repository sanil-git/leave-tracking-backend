# AI-Powered Destination Insights

Intelligent destination and timing analysis for existing PlanWise vacations using external APIs and seasonal data.

## 🎯 Use Case: Smart Vacation Analysis
**Problem**: Users plan vacations but don't know if their timing/destination choices are optimal  
**Solution**: AI analyzes their existing vacation dates and provides intelligent destination recommendations

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **User creates vacation**: "Summer Break - June 15-25, 2025" 
2. **Python script analyzes**: Date range, season, duration, weather patterns
3. **AI recommends**: "Perfect timing for Kashmir (escape summer heat)" or "Consider Bali (great weather, reasonable flights)"
4. **Displays in PlanWise**: Smart insights tile shows recommendations automatically

## 📋 Project Structure
- **Phase 1**: Vacation destination analyzer ✅ COMPLETED
